PROJECT REPORT: QUIZ GAME PREPARATION USING PYTHON

INTROCUCTION

The Quiz Game project will employ Python programming to develop a quiz game for consoles. Players will be presented with multiple-choice questions in the game, and their answers will be immediately evaluated. The scores will be kept track of and displayed after the game. 

OBJECTIVES
->Create a Python-based interactive quiz game.
->Compile a database of multiple-choice questions.
->Keep tabs on and compute the players' scores.
->Show the result and offer comments for each question.
->Permit participants to play the game more than once. 

TECHNOLOGIES USED 
Python: A programming language utilized in the creation of video games.
SQLite: Database management system for storing questions and answers.

SYSTEM DESIGN The components of the quiz game project are as follows:
Main Program Logic: Controls how the game progresses, how questions are presented, and how user input is handled. Storage and retrieval of questions from a SQLite database is handled by database management.
Score Tracking: Records each player's performance and determines the overall score.
User Interface: Displays questions, options, and remarks to the players. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF STEPS 
Step 1: Create an SQLite database to keep the questions and answers. 
Step 2: Write Python code to hook up with the database and retrieve questions. 
Step 3: Develop the sport good judgment to show questions and receive consumer input. 
Step 4: Calculate and tune the player's rating primarily based totally on their answers. 
Step 5: Provide instantaneously remarks on every question. 
Step 6: Display the very last rating and provide the choice to play again. 

CONCLUSION 
The Quiz Game project successfully implements a console-based quiz game using Python. It allows players to answer multiple-choice questions, calculates their score, and provides immediate feedback. The game can be expanded by adding more questions to the database and enhancing the user interface. This project enhances programming skills and knowledge of database management with Python.
By implementing this project, users can enjoy playing an engaging quiz game while also improving their Python programming skills.
